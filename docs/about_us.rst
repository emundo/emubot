Framework
---------
This framework evolved from several projects in which we have utilized different chat platforms and NLP services. After a prior `article about bot architecture
(in german) <https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/betrieb/kuenstliche-intelligenz/natural-language-understanding-nlu.html>`_ we have decided to open source the
framework. An english article with additional details will follow soon.
